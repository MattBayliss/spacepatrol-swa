# Introduction
This is my first [Ironsworn: Starforged](https://starforged.absolutetabletop.com/) solo-rpg game - as such there's lots of mistakes early on - like using the wrong Moves or Oracles and not realising resisting suffer moves was a thing.

I like sci-fi, and space-ships, and role-playing games. These are my session notes.

# Truths

## Cataclysm
Interdimensional entities invaded our reality - corrupting biological scourges

## Exodus
A ragtag fleet of ships - propelled at tremendous speeds by experimental FTL drives

## Communities
Founder clans

## Iron
Vows made on tokens of Black Iron - found on the first worlds in the Forge

## Laws
Laws and governance vary across settled domains, but bounty hunters are given wide latitude to pursue their contracts. Their authority is almost universally recognised and supersedes local laws.

## Religion
Our faith is as diverse as our people.

## Magic
Magic does not exist.

## Communication and Data
Information is life. We rely on spaceborne couriers to transport messages and data across the vast distances between settlements.

## Medicine
To help offset a scarcity of medical supplies and knowledge, the resourceful technicians we call riggers create basic organ and limb replacements.

## Artificial Intelligence
The vestiges of advanced machine intelligence are coveted and wielded by those in power.

## War
Professional soldiers defend or expand the holdings of those who are able to pay. The rest of us are on our own.

## Lifeforms
This is a perilous and often inhospitable galaxy, but life finds a way.

## Precursors
Over eons, a vast number of civilizations rose and fell within the Forge. Today, the folk we call grubs - scavenger crews and audacious explorers - delve into the mysterious monuments and ruins of those ancient beings.

## Horrors
Put enough alcohol in a spacer, and they'll tell you stories of ghost ships crewed by the vengeful dead. It's nonsense.
