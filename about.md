Hi! I'm Matt. This site is starting as my [Ironsworn: Starforged](https://starforged.absolutetabletop.com/) solo-play journals, but maybe will include other solo roleplaying journals in future. I'm really getting a kick out of it, and like re-reading some of my adventures, so thought I'd put them online!

I use (Stargazer)[https://nboughton.uk/apps/stargazer/] by Nick Boughton for most of the Oracle and Move rolls. A lot of settlement, planet, ship details are stored there, but will try to add the oracle rolls to session notes from 22 onwards.

It's also an experiment in learning [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/) - what generates this blog from markdown files.
